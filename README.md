# Angular

## What is Angular? 

A JavaScript framework for building client-side applications (applications that run in the userâ€™s browser). We use tools like HTML CSS and TypeScript to help build out a UI.  

## Why Angular?

-	Makes HTML more expressive
-	Powerful Data Binding connects data directly to the UI
-	Promotes modularity
-	Built-in Back-End integration

## Anatomy of Angular Application:

Angular is made up of several components and services that provide functionality across those components. 

## Angular Component: 

What makes up a component: 

- Template:  Which is the html defining a view for the application. 
  
- Class:  Contains the properties or data elements available for binding to the view and methods which perform actions for the view such as responding to a button click.
  
- Metadata: Provides additional information about the component to Angular.
